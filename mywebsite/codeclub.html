          <p> This is an after school program that will teach students the basics to coding and programming.Students can voluntarily sign up at the school, with Ms. Dallal, or on this website.The club meets once a week, every week, for one semester or the academic year depending on scheduling. All resources and tools are free and provided for attendees.

Code Club offers the opportunity for students to learn how to use something that is becoming ever more prevelant in our daily lives; technology plays a huge part in how we interact with everything now and we need to know how to use it, how to manipulate it, how to change it. Code Club provides students with the tools and knowledge necessary to become active citizens who will become the future of our country.
