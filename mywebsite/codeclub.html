      <h3> About the Club </h3>
        <p> This is an after school program that will teach students the basics to coding and programming.
          Students can voluntarily sign up at the school, with Ms. Dallal, or on this website.
          The club meets once a week, every week, for one semester or the academic year.
          All resources and tools are free and provided for attendees. We will be using a free online
          platform to store and organize our codes so that we can create anything from basic webpages
          to detailed programming.
        </p>
      <h3> Mission Statement </h3>
        <p> Code Club was designed for the purpose of giving students the opportunity to create something
          of their own in safe space, without judgement, without ridicule. Code Club offers the opportunity
          for students to learn how to use something that is becoming ever more prevelant in our daily lives;
          technology plays a huge part in how we interact with everything now and we need to know how to use it,
          how to manipulate it, how to change it. Code Club provides students with the tools and knowledge necessary
          to become active citizens who will become the future of our country.
