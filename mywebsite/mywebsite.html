The Antikythera mechanism (/ˌæntᵻkᵻˈθiːrə/ ant-i-ki-theer-ə or /ˌæntᵻˈkɪθərə/ ant-i-kith-ə-rə) is an ancient Greek analogue computer[1][2][3][4] and orrery used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes.[5][6][7] It could also track the four-year cycle of athletic games which was similar, but not identical, to an Olympiad, the cycle of the ancient Olympic Games.[8][9][10]</td>

The artefact was recovered on May 17, 1902[14][15] from the Antikythera shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, which in antiquity was known as Aigila.[16] Believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists, the instrument has been variously dated to about 87 BC,[17] or between 150 and 100 BC,[5] or in 205 BC,[18][19] or within a generation before the date of the shipwreck (in about 150 BC). </td>
