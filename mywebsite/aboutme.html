      <h3> About Me </h3>
        <p> I grew up in New Jersey and Texas; I was first homeschooled then started high school in San Antonio.
          I decided to move to Chicago for college and received my Bachelors degree from DePaul University.
          I am so glad I came to the city, I absolutely love it! I also really enjoy cats and watching psychological
          thrillers on Netflix. When I have time I like to read sci-fi adventure novels.
          All of the sciences fascinate me, I am always looking to learn more (especially when it's with Bill Nye!).
