Things I learned...
- md: a markdown file which is this, just has lists or words
- pwd: shows me where I am, what directory/folder I'm working in
- ls: shows me everything inside where I am
- dir: goes to a directory
- mkdir: makes a new directory/folder
- cd: changes what directory I'm working in
- push: puts my current work up on the internet thing
- commit: saves work
- git status: what's been done, what's changed, what needs to be done...
- git hub: the internet thing
- cp: copy
- git pull: takes something from the other thing into current thing
- repository: total folder area, like a portfolio
- git add: get things ready to be committed
- staging area: done after "git add" so I can "commit" a certain group of things

Things I don't know yet...
Using which/where git on powershell doesn't work. I think one TA said the way I downloaded git bash doesn't let the two communicate.
I was doing a tutorial on Code Academy I think and something wasn't working...
