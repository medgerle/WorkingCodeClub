# Design Challenges - Session 1
## Problem 1:
Underpriveleged (high school) students do not have access to the tools necessary for tech growth.
- How might we provide access to the tools necessary for underprivileged high school students to learn about important tech advances?
- Solutions:
1. Create a free after school club/program
2. Apply for government funding/grants to get computers
3. Provide training for teachers
- Impact Statement: Underpriveleged high school students will have the knowledge and confidence necessary to excel in any career following high school graduation.
- Constraints:
1. Students may not have computer/internet access at home
2. Administrators may not approve of the after school club/program
3. Interest may be lacking in order to launch
4. There may not be space/time available at the school/facility
- Context:
1. Inner city schools
2. Underfunded, underprivileged, low-socioeconomic schools and students
3. Diverse student body with ill-representation in goverment
## Problem 2:
Low socioeconomic students have low motivation.
- How might we encourage students to get motivated about learning and pursuing college?
- Solutions:
1. Provide students with a new subject that is directly/immediately useful for them
2. Create a safe space for students to learn and create and share their new learning
3. Provide them with different college and career paths and resources with relevant examples
- Impact Statement: A new generation of adults will become competent citizens capable of fully understanding the world and changing things for the better.
- Constraints:
1. Students' home lives
2. Limits enforced by administration(s)
3. Lack of appropriate and diverse representation for students
- Context:
1. United States inner city schools
2. Underfunded, underprivileged, low-socioeconomic schools and students
3. Post-secondary school prices are unattainable
## Problem 3:
Underserved districts lack appropriate funding for a tech focused curriculum.
- How might we raise funding for tech focused curriculum in underserved schools?
- Solutions:
1. Create an appeal for government funding
2. Repeal Betsey DeVos
3. Fix the US Government
- Impact Statement: Schools will have the appropriate funding to provide adequate education to everyone.
- Constraints:
1. Trump is president
2. Betsey DeVos is Secretary of Education
3. US Government sucks
- Context:
1. US teachers are underappreciated and not treated as professionals
2. US schools are last on the government's priorty list
3. Technology is not seen as the most important in curriculum
### All three problems are similar and work together but I will be focusing on the first one.
